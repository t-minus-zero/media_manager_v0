Info:
storage/procedures/android/ *all android procedures here
procedures naming convention -> appname_procedure_name.json


TO DO NOW:
[]  add reload procedures in /procedures to test them out without restarting the whole thing
[]  make the request and response to the server be non-blocking
[]  add a way to catch the response from the server

[]  Create intermediary procedures for example to open-close soda or other apps and implement checks if it works.

[]  Whenever one of the buttons or thing in the current procedure can't be found, start the soda troubleshooting procedure:
    this will go trough different checks to understand what could be the issue and solve it, for example, if there is a 
    adv or if the pro functions is not avalable, or if internet is down etc.

[] Adjust the returning, saving and updating of the ui in the gui
[] Add saving of the queues and reloading


TO DO LATER:
[] Implement logger utility in fastHTML server
[] have Kitt spin-up the android-server using a subprocess command / not-needed
[]  get realtime updates of the current procedure in the test ui  
[] Buy soda to remove the ads
[] Create Schedule metadata and component
[]  Check and group together procedures that are the same in a row in a single job.
Send the instructions list alone and not have the server load the procedures.
