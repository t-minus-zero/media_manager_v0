Add Scripts as elements inside a parent element without script tags
Can be called doing this in the elements: onclick=f"closeBottomSheet('{sheet_id}')"



Each component that changes should have it's constructor receive the state it needs.

Have a behaviour script for each action.
    Each action has additional changes depending on if a page is open or not,
    unless if htmx does not do anything if the id of the content that needs to change is not there
    if this is the case, then it can just do everything both on smal land large screens the same.
